    I’m Henrik Nyh. I was born <span id="birthday">July 26, 1983</span> and live in Stockholm, Sweden with [Johanna](http://johannaost.com).

    I currently work as a developer (mostly Ruby on Rails) at [Barsoom](http://barsoom.se/). I have a master’s degree in computational linguistics, though I’ve found I enjoy computers and linguistics more when they’re separate.

    These days, I'm more likely to [tweet](http://twitter.com/henrik), [gist](https://gist.github.com/henrik) or [GitHub](http://github.com/henrik) findings and experiences than to write a blog post. But you never know!

    You can reach me at [@henrik](http://twitter.com/henrik) or <henrik@nyh.se>.


    I enjoy reading, running, hitting the gym, travel, cooking, baking, photography and pugs, but web development is my main interest. I’m particularly into user interfaces and awesome touches. I love solving small problems really well. I’m very much into automation and hate seeing a human doing a computer’s job.

    ## This blog

    This blog is all static files, generated by [my fork of Jekyll](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll), with [Disqus](http://disqus.com) for comments. I forked it before I learned to respect a test suite, so beware.

    Unless otherwise noted, all code I publish is under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

    As for the name, I simply like pugs and automation. Oh, and “pug” sounds vaguely like “blog”.
