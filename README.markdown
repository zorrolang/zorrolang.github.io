# The Pug Automatic

This directory contains data for my blog, [The Pug Automatic](http://henrik.nyh.se).

It's automatically transformed by my mutated version of [Jekyll](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll) (Hyde? Mr. Haml?) into a static site. Jekyll was created by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/).


## Setup

I keep my version of Jekyll in `~/Projects/jekyll` and add its `bin` dir to my `PATH`:

    export PATH=~/Projects/jekyll/bin:$PATH

Install gem dependencies:

    gem install bundler
    bundle

Install Pygments for syntax highlighting:

    sudo easy_install Pygments

Generate blog with:

    jekyll

The `config.ru` files means you can see the generated site locally with [Pow](http://pow.cx/) or any other Rack-compatible server. Or use Apache.

If it looks fine, generate and deploy with:

    tasks/deploy
